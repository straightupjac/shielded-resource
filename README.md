# shielded resource üõ°Ô∏è
This project's goal is to create a proof of concept site that can help educate domestic violence victims, women seeking abortions and other marginalized populations about digital privacy and provide support for those suffering from technology enabled abuse. This is a proof-of-concept and is not meant to be used as a replacement for any professional resources. 

## design process
This tool was built for CS 497, a class on Discrimination in Computing. Before we built this project, which is targeted at vulnerable user groups, we ensured to research the implications of our project on all stakeholders involved. We followed an ethical design process to ensure that our tool would not inadvertently harm the groups we were hoping to help. Our user research and design process is documented here.
